# INFO
`roygbiv` is a simple program which takes a string as input as well as some options (seen by running `roygbiv --help`) to control the color gradient, and applies said color gradient to a string of text as supported by truecolor terminals, then finally prints the colored text to standard output.

Just something I made in my free time--I might post an image of examples at some point.
